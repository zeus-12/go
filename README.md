## Go (Not the language)

### Create permanent short links for files, URLs, or large text with custom slugs in seconds.

Created for personal use, feel free to use it/
Currently just a slighly updated version of [Theos Link shortener](https://github.com/t3dotgg/joltik), didnt really test it, just wanted to make it work for my use case.

ToDo

- add a "text-field" (inputarea kind) and "file-upload" alternative to the "url-field". (if file or ulr simply redirect to that, if text, then a separate page dislaying that)
- maybe a simple analytics down the road. xd
- password authentication to access the data. (either have the master password ,or custom password for each link)
