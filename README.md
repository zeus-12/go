## Go (PS: Not the language)

### Create permanent short links for files, URLs, or large text with custom slugs in seconds.

(WIP, private, password protection). Created for personal use.

Currently just a slighly updated version of [Theos Link shortener](https://github.com/t3dotgg/joltik), didnt really test it, just wanted to make it work for my use case.

ToDo

- add a "text-field" and "file-upload" alternative to the "url-field".
- maybe a simple analytics down the road. xd
